My name is Cameron Parker, and this is a snapshot of my journey into tech. 
After years in logistics and operations, I made the decision to pivot into Cloud and DevOps engineering — a move that challenged me to rebuild from the ground up. 
Every late-night lab, every failed script, and every breakthrough has taught me something new about persistence, growth, and believing in the process. 
Through my work with Pixel Learning Co., I’m reminded that technology isn’t just about automation — it’s about accessibility, creativity, and empowering others to learn in new ways. 
What started as curiosity has become a purpose — to create, automate, and build smarter systems that make a real impact.
